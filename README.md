## Updates

8/18/20

The following work was done in preparation of hosting this app on other providers (AWS, Google) and then maybe trying my hand at Terraform.

1. forked group project: https://github.com/azu20/real-estate
2. created new Heroku deployment: https://codydevloop-washburn-realestat.herokuapp.com/
3. created new MongoDB Atlas cluster and connected to app and Heroku
4. created new Auth0 application and updated connection variables
-- **the new Auth0 is still somehow connected to the original app's user DB. Ex.  I can authenticate with users I created in the original app that was forked. I know there is a way to seperate these and will dig into Auth0 documentation sometime. I also need also need to dig into the whitelist information for MongoDB Atlas.
5. created env variables for API key, Auth0 varibles, MongodDB atlas.
-- need to install (npm dotenv) in order to read backend .env file.
6. cleaned up other random code as i ran into it.
